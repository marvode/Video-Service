        Evision360 reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change,

        <li>Miscellaneous <br>
        Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms
        of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If
        any provision of the Terms of Use is found by a court of competent
        jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the
        court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as
        reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of
        Use remain in full force and effect.</li>
